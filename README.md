<h1>Project Mania</h1>
<p>
    A work-in-progress Sonic Mania* "Data.rsdk" loader for Android 
  </p>
get rotated idiot i won't provide one
</div>

## Overview
* Â¹ (2019) Brandon Team did so fucking bad on their Sonic Mania remake
* Â² Fast forward 3 years later and boom we got someone who decompiled RSDKv5(u) for us Â²

## To use the app:
Simple, just grab your Sonic Mania's `Data.rsdk` from your computer.</p>
,then put the `Data.rsdk` over `/games/jett/manialoader`</p>
Don't ask why i don't provide one. That's called **piracy**
### NOTES:
This is specifically made for Mediatek devices. 

Go flex with your Snapdragon everywhere and say "HEyy GUYz lOOk sOnic mANia ON aNDroID hAHA i bET meDiATek lOSerS caNt rUN iT lOoOlðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£"

## TODO:
### On priority
* [ ] Fix the workflow, actually will going to build the Application over action builds
* [ ] OPTIONAL: if MGRich's fragment shader, gles, and RSDKv5 pushes doesn't work, i'll have to use GL4ES
